# Public Transport Network Graph Modelling using GTFS Data

This repository provides tools for processing GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) data to model public transport networks as graphs. It includes notebooks for parsing, cleaning, and analyzing GTFS data, with support for multiple cities. Our code focuses on the Belgian data, particularly rail lines. There is also some work on the Chicago data (provided by Dr. Renzo Massobrio (renzo.massobrio@uantwerpen.be)), which we took as a reference to while working on the Belgian data.

## 🛠 Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.  
**Note:** macOS is not supported.

### 1. Install Miniconda

Download and install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

### 2. Install Build Tools

Depending on your OS:

- **Windows:**  
  Download and install the **Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools**:  
  [Visual Studio Downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)  
  During installation, select **"Desktop Development with C++"**.

- **Linux:**  
  Install the GCC compiler:  
  ```bash
  sudo apt install build-essential
  ```
### 3. Set Up the Conda Environment
Open Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or a terminal (Linux) and navigate to the project directory:

- **Windows:**
  ```bash
  D:
  cd Documents\GTFS_TO_NETWORK
  ```
- **Linux:**
  ```bash
  cd /path/to/repo
  ```

Create the environment using:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### 4. Run the Jupyter Notebook
Activate the environment and start Jupyter:
```bash
conda activate pt-networks
jupyter notebook
```
In your browser, select a notebook from the list (e.g., Belgium Railways.ipynb) to begin your analysis.
